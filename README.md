# estdaR

This package contains a function to interactively harmonize data with problems like spelling errors, acronym abbreviations, and names listed differently.

We have no intentions in the short run to upload the package to the CRAN. The package 'devtools' is required to install the package

```r{output="html"}
devtools::install_github("amvallone/msp")
```
The package is still on a development stage. Please, feel free to contribute to improving it. In case of errors, please, open a new issue.
